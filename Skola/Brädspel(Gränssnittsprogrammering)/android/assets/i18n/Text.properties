tutorialWelcome=Hello and welcome to Forbidden Desert!
tutorialWelcomeText=A game where a group of people have crashed in the desert with their flying ship.\n\

moves available. \n \
Move action, which moves your pawn. \n \
Remove sand, which removes sand from tiles.\n \
Excavate action, which flips a tile over. \n \
Pick up a part move, which picks a part of the flying ship up.

tutorialMove=The move action
tutorialMoveText=The first action is the move action. You may move your pawn to an adjacent \n \
unblocked tile for 1 action per move. You may not move diagonally \n \
A tile is considered blocked if there are 2 or more Sand markers on it. \n \
You may also never move through the black space containing the Sand Storm.

tile right of the highlighted character.

step closer to escaping the desert! Now you stand on a tile without \n\
sand, perfect! Let's try to flip it!

Move is already selected so just click on the tile right of you!

tutorialSuccessMove2=Sand!

To flip this tile you need to remove the sand first, highlight \n\
the "Remove sand" button and click on the tile you're standing on.

tutorialDigMove=No actions left
tutorialSuccessDigText=You're out of actions, what to do?!\n\
Let's click end turn and see what storm cards will show up!

tutorialStormCards=The storm moved!
tutorialStormCardsText=As you probably noticed the storm moved and some cards showed up.\n\
Noticed that our log shows exactly what happened?\n\
First it was the storm movement, the storm randomly moved one step \n\
to the right. The storm can move in every direction up to three steps.

tutorialStormCards2=Weird cards showed up
tutorialStormCardsText2=The cards that showed up was not good for your adventurers. \n\
Sun beats down means that every unprotected adventurer loses one water, if it \n\
reaches 0 you lose. \n\
Storm picks up means that you're closer to increasing the storm level one step. \n\
Get enough of these cards and the level will increase to 4, then the game \n\
will draw four storm cards after each turn.

tutorialNextPlayer=Next players turn
tutorialNextPlayerText=Now it's the other pawns time to shine!\n\
Since both adventurers lost one water, why don't try to refill it?\n\
The tile up north looks like a well, go there and see if you can refill\n\
some water. Note that one of the three well-tiles is always dry and wont\n\
generate water to your character

tutorialnextPlayerFlip=Flip it!
tutorialnextPlayerFlipText=You probably know what to do! Flip it!

tutorialWaterFound=You found water!
tutorialWaterFoundText=Lucky you! The well was not dry, every pawn on that tile\n\
gets 2 water. Move up north and see what's there!

tutorialDigAgain=Remove the sand
tutorialDigAgainText=Take out your shovel again, it's time to dig! \n\
Select Remove Sand and click on the tile you're standing on.

tutorialEndTurn=No actions left, again!
tutorialEndTurnText=As you can see up to your right we're out of actions again.\n\
End your turn.

nextPlayersTurn=Player 1 again!
nextPlayersTurnText=Back to player 1 again, but lets talk about what happened \n\
with the sand in the east! As you can see, on some tiles we have gotten\n\
more then one sand, sand have gotten red. This means that our\n\
pawns cannot move on to them without removing the sand first!

nextPlayersTurn2=Lets focus on you
nextPlayersTurnText2=You are standing on a tile without any sand, why not flip it?

movePickUpPart=Look!
movePickUpPartText=A part appeared on the tile left of you! \n\

tutorialLastTurn2=Last turn!
tutorialLastTurnText2=This is the last thing you have to learn. \n\
Go north one step and flip the tile, don't worry, I'll guide you!

tutorialFinalDialog=A tunnel!
tutorialFinalDialogText=If you stand in a tunnel when the card \n\
"Sun goes down" is drawn, you are protected and don't lose any water.

tutorialFinalDialog2=Tutorial finished
tutorialFinalDialogText2=Now it's time that you take on the real challenge!\n\
Just one last thing! One tile that you will have to discover by yourself is \n\
the launch pad.\n\
To get your crew to safety you have to collect all the parts and go to the launch pad\n\
before you run out of sand, die of thirst or the storm level reaches 8.\n\
*NOTE* The tiny buttons in the player screens to your right are not implemented yet *NOTE*\n\
Good luck!

sometimes contain wells. The second type of tile are gear tiles that when excavated\

own unique ability available to play in Forbidden Desert. The first one is the \n \
Archeologist, who has the ability to remove 2 sand from any single tile \n \
instead of 1 for 1 action. The second one is the Climber, who has the \n \
ability to move to blocked tiles and he may also take other players \n \
with him when he moves. Pawns on the Climber's tile are never buried \n \
and can leave the tile containing the climber even if there are 2 or \n \
more Sand markers on it. The third adventurer is the Explorer. \n \
The Explorer can move, remove sand, and may use the Dune Blaster \n \
item diagonally. The fourth adventurer is the Meterologist. The \n \
Meterologist may spend actions to draw fewer Storm cards \n \
(1 card per action) at the end of her turn. She may also \n \
She may also choose to spend 1 action to look at the \n \
top Storm cards, equal to the Storm level, and may \n \
place one at the bottom of the deck. The fifth adventurer is the \n \
Navigator. The Navigator may move another player up to 3 \n \
unblocked tiles per action, including tunnels. \n \
She can move the Explorer diagonally and can move \n \
the Climber through blocked tiles. When moved in this way, \n \
the Climber can also use his power to take along 1 other \n \
player—including the Navigator! The final adventurer is the Water carrier \n \
The Water Carrier can take 2 water from already excavated wells\n \
for 1 action.  She may also give water to players on adjacent tiles for \n \
free at anytime. The Water Carrier also starts with 5 (instead of 4) water.

tutorialDigOut=Being buried
tutorialDigOutText=If your pawn is on a tile that has 2 or more Sand markers, \n \
you become "buried" in the sand and must remove Sand markers down to one or none \n \
before you can take any further actions. Teammates may also spend actions during \n \
their turns to help remove sand from a buried player's tile.

tutorialStormDeck=What is the Sand Storm deck?

of cards from the Sand Storm deck equal to the current Sand Storm meter level. \n \
